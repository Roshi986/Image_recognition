When a large number of certain type objects are presented to NN, the computer learns from it and can successfully learn to categorise new images based on its learning.

    "Deep learning has been very popular in recent years and one of the great ways to use deep learning for image classification is using a convolutional neural network (CNN).CNN  learns the internal features looking at both local and global features making them more efficient in image recognition. The first layer in CNN is always a convolutional layer \n",
    "to extract features from an imput image and the filters are feature identifiers. Stride is the number of pixel shifts over the input matrix. If the images are too big, pooling layer reduces the number of parameters. After the features identification, there is a fully connected layer at the end of the network where it takes an input volume and outputs an N dimensional vector where N is the number of classes. The convolutional layers detects the same patterns in different parts of the image and the pooling merges similar features. This makes them more efficient by being able to detect features anywhere. "

Relu is used in most neural networks and are computionally simpler compared to other sctivation functions.It can output a true zero value causing sparse representation which can speed up learning process and simplify the model (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). However, it might not be the most efficient when there are lots of layers.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "In these experiment, it can be seen that for hog_ros dataset, any of the classifier can perform well with an accuracy of almost 100%. For all the classifiers and datasets, it is possible to improve the performance of the models by tuning the hyper parameters (optimisers, activation function and learning rates) and improving the validation framework. Splitting the datasets could be improved by further splitting the training sets into validation set to validate the model’s performance on unseen data or using k-fold cross validation and looking at performance on each fold. Other metrics such as error rates could also be useful in deciding the best classifier as accuracy alone cannot be the perfect measure of the performance. Other measures such as precision, sensitivity and specificity might also be useful and looking at the statistical significance of the accuracy and loss of each of the classifiers would also be important. \n",
